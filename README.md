# Welcome to Juan Carballo Sepe's GitHub Profile! 👋

## About Me
😎 Hello! I'm Juan Carballo Sepe, a passionate technology enthusiast and Java backend developer. Currently, I'm pursuing a degree in Systems Analysis at the ORT Technological Institute.

🚀 I specialize in Java programming language, primarily utilizing it for creating the backend of monolithic applications and RESTful APIs. Additionally, I leverage Spring Cloud to develop applications with a backend based on microservices architecture.

🤖 My secondary backend programming language is JavaScript, utilizing Node.js with Express.js to create HTTP servers and RESTful APIs.

🤓 I'm currently expanding my skillset by learning React for frontend development and getting started with Spring Security for enhanced application security.
